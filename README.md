Sliding Number Puzzle (3×3 Grid) is a classic 8-puzzle game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The puzzle consists of 8 numbered tiles and one empty space on a 3×3 grid. The objective is to arrange the tiles in ascending order (1 to 8), with the empty space at the end, by sliding tiles into the empty cell.
